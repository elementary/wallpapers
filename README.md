Wallpapers for elementary OS

## General wallpaper guidelines

Check out existing wallpapers to see what we're into. For starters, we typically prefer simple, pleasing photographs of nature with a shallow depth of field. Wallpapers that are less busy, have a single focal point, and are generally more out of focus near the edges are more likely to be chosen. 

Also keep in mind the desktop environment: elementary OS has a transparent panel at the top, so wallpapers with lower-contrast top areas will look best. If the area under the panel is too high-contrast, it automatically get masked with a dark translucent overlay. We also use a small white dock at the bottom, and icons hang over the top edge of the dock. Wallpapers with less-busy, lower contrast areas near the bottom will look better.

* Wallpapers should look good in Pantheon on elementary OS
* Not too distracting if a non-maximized window is open
* No text or logos
* No people
* We prefer photographic wallpapers, but digital/abstract isn't 100% out of the question
* We prefer not to have photos with a single domesticated animal as a focus point
* Wallpapers should be at least 3200Ã—1800px

### For Reference

elementary OS desktop, with the adaptive light and dark panel based on the wallpaper:

| Light Wallpaper                           | Dark Wallpaper                           |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |

You should avoid busy parts of the wallpaper in the top panel and bottom dock areas.
