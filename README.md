Wallpapers for elementary OS

This is currently a private repo to collect wallpapers for elementary OS. Eventually we should upload all previous wallpapers, ensure all licensing info is accurate, then open the repo.

## To add a wallpaper for Loki

1. Make sure your wallpaper is openly-licensed and okay for commercial use
2. Fork the project and add the wallpaper to the `loki` folder
3. Add license info to the `loki/copyright` file
4. Create a pull request.
5. 

Lots of wallpapers will be accepted into this repo for consideration, but we will trim it down to our favorited before release.
